This application uses [`devise`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication and [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for its stylesheets.

It also employs [`capybara`](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) in some of its [tests](https://github.com/jeffminnear/within-a-week/tree/master/spec/features) to simulate real user interaction.
